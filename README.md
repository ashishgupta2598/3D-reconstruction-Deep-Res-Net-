# 3D-reconstruction-Deep-Res-Net
It Contains two files.One is for data preparation(Preparation Dataset.ipynb) as the directory structure is Bit complex.
And the other one is for traning and testing(Contains Deep Res Net).

# DataSet
DataSet is taken from 3D R2N2 Research Paper.
Datasets They used ShapeNet models to generate rendered images and voxelized models. Links are available below. \
ShapeNet rendered images http://cvgl.stanford.edu/data2/ShapeNetRendering.tgz \
ShapeNet voxelized models http://cvgl.stanford.edu/data2/ShapeNetVox32.tgz

# Binvox
We have our 3D models in the form of .binox files. So for the conversion to binary voxel array we have Python module binvox-rw-py. \
